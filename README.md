# This is my react assignment project at learnathon 2.0 powered by Vivasoft.

### Project Requirements:

    1. Basic folder structure.
    2. Data fetching with API.
    3. Show data results in the UI.
    4. Error and Loading states should be shown in the UI (while fetching data).
    5. Add a simple dropdown filter in the UI. (Data should show based on this value if set, else show  all data).

#### In this Project I used `"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/"` API for fetch the data and raw css
